    "You may be used to executing R commands line by line in RStudio, if so, forget about that approach.  It is (perhaps, probably not) fine while you are developing a new R script, but that approach is inherently interactive, and hence doesn't lend itself well to HPC systems, where most scripts are executed in batch mode, i.e., without any user interaction.  You will need to think in terms of R scripts that are completely executed from top to bottom.\n",
